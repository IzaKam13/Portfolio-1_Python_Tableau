# Sales & Logistics Analytics & Dashboard - Portfolio Project

This project showcases an end-to-end workflow for transforming raw sales data into actionable business insights using **Python** and **Tableau**.

## Project Objective

To simulate a real-world reporting scenario often seen in ERP systems — where business stakeholders need a quick overview of **sales performance**, **costs**, **client activity**, and **product trends**.

## Tools & Skills Demonstrated

- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** - data cleaning and preprocessing
- **Python (Faker)** - ![data generation](https://github.com/IzaKam13/Portfolio-1_Sales-Logistics_Python-Tableau-Dashboard/blob/main/notebooks/creating_dummy_data.ipynb)
- **Tableau** – visual analytics and dashboard creation
- **Data Handling** – working with CSV files and structured business data
- **KPI Development** – identifying and preparing metrics for reporting

## Key Metrics
